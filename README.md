# SEEM3650  Introduction to Data and Decision Analytics Course Project
Prediction on crime rate using unemployment rate, GDP, and police force count

# Objective
This project is dedicated to analyzing and predicting the effect of unemployment rate, gross domestic product (GDP), and the police force count on the crime rate in Hong Kong. Through analyzing the relationship between the variables and the crime rate, the goal of the project is to predict the future crime rate. The prediction shall be used as a reference for the Hong Kong government to prevent crime rate from surging, thus the society disorder. 
Three methods are used for the data analysis, linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression tree. As the project requires prediction of data, instead of classification, these three methods are chosen. L1 regularization is used in the beginning of the analysis for checking not useful variables. The regularization showed the importance of all variables and none of them are eliminated. After testing three methods, the random forest regression tree is chosen as the final solution for the model. 

# SETUP:
